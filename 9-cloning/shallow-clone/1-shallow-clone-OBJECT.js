/**
 * SHALLOW CLONE OF AN OBJECT
 *    - using spread operator
 *          - let copy_obj = {...obj}
 *          - if object property's value = primitive type, it is copied by value
 *                - hence, updating such a property (primitive) won't modify original object
 *          - if object property's value = non-primitive type, it is copied by reference
 *                - hence, updating such a property (non-primitive) modifies original object  
 *                - to simplify things we say, it does a shallow copy
 *              - SHALLOW COPY:
 *                   - one level deep elements are copied by value
 *                        - it means if one-level deep copy elements are modified, original object remains same
 *                   - deeper elements (level >1) are copied by reference
 *                        - it means if deeper copy elements are modified, original object also modified       
 *    - using assignment operator
 *          - let copy_obj = obj
 *          - each object property's value - whether primitive or non-primitive is referenced
 *          - hence, updating the copy object's property value modifies original object
 *          - this way is copy by reference (shallow copy is different)
