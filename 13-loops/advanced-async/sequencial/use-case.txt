// scenario
    Below are time taking functions which return a promise and resolve after a minimum of 1 sec
        wake,brush,eat,school,sleep

 Requirement:
    Execute them in the order sequencially:
        wake -> brush -> eat -> school -> sleep      


// there are three approaches in this file:
    simple async await
        use when limited tasks to be performed
    for loop

    for Await of
        very good but we need to create generators first
